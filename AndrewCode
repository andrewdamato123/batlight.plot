geom_magnify <- function(x,y,x0,y0,r) {
  dt1<-data.frame(x=x, y=y,x0=x0,y0=y0,r=r)
  
### Starting Point ###
layer(geom="point",data =dt1, mapping = aes(x=x,y=y), stat = "identity", position = "identity") 

### Circle ###
layer(geom = GeomCircle,  data = dt1, mapping = aes(x0=x0, y0=y0, r= r),    stat = "circle", position = "identity" )

### Left Segment ###
layer(geom = GeomSegment, data = dt1, mapping = aes(x=x,y=y,xend=x0-r,yend=y0), stat = "identity", position = "identity" )

### Right Segment ###
layer(geom = GeomSegment, data = dt1, mapping = aes(x=x,y=y,xend=x0+r,yend=y0), stat = "identity", position = "identity" )

### Horizontal Segment ###
layer(geom = GeomSegment, data = dt1, mapping = aes(x=x0-r,y=y0,xend=x0+r,yend=y0), stat = "identity", position = "identity" )

### Vertical Segment ###
layer(geom = GeomSegment, data = dt1, mapping = aes(x=x0,y=y0-r,xend=x0,yend=y0+r), stat = "identity", position = "identity" )
}



### example ###
ggplot() + geom_magnify(x = 2, y = 3, x0 = 4, y0 = 2, r=0.5)


#Issues:

#  Each Layer function replaces (or possibly lays over) 
#  the previous one so only the last layer line shows when the function is called)
#  I tried adding plus signs at the end of each layer line, but that gives an error

#  Not sure where I can adjust the line type to make lines dashed. 
#  I tried adding it to the aesthetics, using the same variable 
#  names as found in the source code for ggplot2/ggforce, but it gives an error

#  The math required to find the lines tangent to the circle is very complex
#  Given a specific starting point of the batlight and position and radius of the circle, 
#  I can figure out the equation of the tangent line with a pen and paper, 
#  but I don't know how to code the function to figure it out on its own.
